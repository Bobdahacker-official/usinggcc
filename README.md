## USINGGCC
gcc butt better in alot of things (if u check the source code and think its ai its not. i used ai for the comments so i dont forget where to put things. rest made all my me)
DO NOT say "Oh but you used gcc for it how is it better??" IT HAS MORE FILE FORMATS AND AN EASIER-SETUP-UI.

Other Than That!; Enjoy!
